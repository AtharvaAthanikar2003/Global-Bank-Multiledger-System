# 🌍 GlobalBank Multi-Ledger Banking System

🚀 Full-Stack Banking Platform | Backend Engineering + Databricks SQL Analytics

---

## 📌 Overview

GlobalBank Multi-Ledger Banking System is a full-stack banking application designed to simulate core financial workflows including account management, transaction handling, and ledger-based operations.

This project focuses on system design, backend logic, and analytical query workflows rather than production-scale data volume.

Built using:

💻 Backend Engineering (Python)  
🌐 Frontend Development (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)  
🗄️ Lightweight Persistence (SQLite)  
📊 Databricks SQL & Compute  

---

## 🎯 ATS-Friendly Summary

Developed a full-stack banking system prototype implementing transaction workflows, ledger simulation, and database-backed persistence. Leveraged Databricks SQL notebooks as a compute and analytics engine to perform financial data queries and analysis.

Relevant for:

✅ Software Development Engineer (SDE)  
✅ Backend Engineer  
✅ Data / Analytics Engineer  

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

• Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
• Backend: Python (ASGI Application)  
• Database: SQLite (Prototype Persistence Layer)  
• Analytics & Compute: Databricks SQL Notebook / Workspace  

---

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Multi-ledger banking simulation  
✅ Account & transaction workflows  
✅ Backend business logic implementation

## 🗄️ Database Design (SQLite)

SQLite was used as a lightweight persistence layer to simulate:

✅ Account records  
✅ Transaction entries  
✅ Financial reference data  

Key Notes:

• Database designed for functional simulation, not scale  
• Sample dataset populated using hardcoded seed records  
• Used to validate backend workflows & query logic  
• Enabled rapid prototyping & simplified local setup  

---

## 📊 Databricks Analytics Usage

Databricks was leveraged primarily as a compute & SQL analytics engine.

Usage includes:

✅ Executing analytical SQL queries  
✅ Performing financial data aggregations  
✅ Exploring transaction-level insights  
✅ Query experimentation & analysis  

Example analytical scenarios:

📈 Transaction pattern analysis  
💰 Balance-level summaries  
🔎 Ledger aggregations  
📊 SQL-based financial reporting

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### ✅ Clone the repository  
"git clone https://github.com/AtharvaAthanikar2003/Global-Bank-Multiledger-Banking-System.git"  

---

### ✅ Create a virtual environment (recommended)  
"python -m venv venv"

---

### ✅ Activate the virtual environment  

Windows  
"venv\Scripts\activate"

Mac / Linux  
"source venv/bin/activate"

---

### ✅ Install dependencies  
"pip install -r requirements.txt"

---

### ✅ Configure environment variables (if applicable)

"DATABASE_URL=bank.db"
